# AI-Rael-Estate-Agent
Finding the perfect property involves sifting through countless listings across multiple websites, analyzing location trends, and making informed investment decisions. For developers and real estate professionals, automating this process can save hours of manual work while providing deeper market insights.
we'll build an AI Real Estate Agent that automates property search and market analysis. This agent will help users find properties matching their criteria while providing detailed location trends and investment recommendations, all through a clean user interface.

Let's look at our powerful tech stack:

Firecrawl's Extract Endpoint: A newly released API endpoint that simplifies collecting structured data from any number of URLs or entire domains, handling everything from crawling to parsing and organizing real estate data into clean, analysis-ready formats.

Agno (formerly Phidata): An open-source framework for building AI agents with memory and reasoning capabilities, helping us create specialized agents for property analysis.

OpenAI GPT-4o: The language model powering our agent's analysis and recommendations, providing human-like understanding of property details and market trends.

Streamlit: Creates a clean, interactive web interface for our real estate agent with minimal code.
